Based on the student retention analysis presentation provided, I would showcase key aspects in a data analytics portfolio:

Data Preparation:
Handling redundancies and merging datasets while maintaining integrity
Techniques like pivoting, grouping, exclusion to consolidate data

Exploratory Analysis:
Use of SEMMA framework to sample, explore and understand the data
Summary statistics on target variable, splits for modeling
Model Building and Evaluation

Multiple models tested:
logistic regression, decision tree, gradient boosting etc.
Performance comparison on accuracy, precision, recall, F1, error

Visualized Insights:
Charts on retention rate vs grants, student clubs, departments
Summary of trends and insights on attrition factors
Strategic Recommendations

Solutions addressing:
financial support, academic challenges, engagement
Tied to analysis findings around key areas of improvement

Communication
Presentation conveying analysis outcomes to stakeholders
Dashboard mockups to summarize analytical 

conclusions
This project captures the end-to-end data analysis process from preparation to modeling to visualization and recommendations. The specific examples demonstrate skills in statistical analysis, data wrangling, modeling, visual communication and translating analysis into strategic decisions. Let me know if you need any other examples or projects to highlight!
